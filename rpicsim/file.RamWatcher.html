<h1 id="label-RAM+watcher">RAM watcher</h1>

<p>When writing a <a href="file.UnitTesting.html" title="unit test">unit test</a> for some part of your
firmware, you should probably test any RAM variable that the code is
supposed to write to, and make sure that it contains the correct value
after the code executes. However, it is also helpful to try to make sure
that your code does not write to any other parts of memory; it should only
write to the places that you were expecting it to write to.</p>

<p>RPicSim's <em>RAM watcher</em> lets you see all the places in RAM
(including SFRs) that were written by your code. It detects writes to RAM
even if the underlying RAM value didn't change. For example, if your
program runs a <code>clrf x</code> instruction, the RAM watcher will detect
this even if <code>x</code> was already equal to 0.</p>

<p>Also, it detects writes from instructions like "<code>movf x, F</code>",
which is usually not desired. That instruction affects the STATUS register
and allows you to see if <code>x</code> is zero, but it should not affect
<code>x</code> if it is a normal variable in RAM. However, that instruction
technically counts as a read from <code>x</code> and a write of the same
value back to <code>x</code>, so the RAM watcher detects the write and will
report it.</p>

<p>Please note that the RAM watcher works well in MPLAB X 1.85 and 1.90 but
the latest versions of MPLAB X have an issue that makes the RAM watcher
useless. For more information, see <a href="file.KnownIssues.html" title="KnownIssues">KnownIssues</a>.</p>

<p>To create a new RAM watcher object, call <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Sim.html#new_ram_watcher-instance_method" title="RPicSim::Sim#new_ram_watcher (method)">RPicSim::Sim#new_ram_watcher</a></span>.
There is a shortcut for this method, so if you are using RPicSim's
<a href="file.RSpecIntegration.html" title="RSpec integration">RSpec integration</a> then you can just write:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_ram_watcher'>ram_watcher</span> <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_new_ram_watcher'>new_ram_watcher</span></code></pre>

<p>The resulting object is an instance of the <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/MemoryWatcher.html" title="RPicSim::MemoryWatcher (class)">RPicSim::MemoryWatcher</a></span> class
and has two important methods:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/MemoryWatcher.html#writes-instance_method" title="RPicSim::MemoryWatcher#writes (method)">writes</a></span> method provides a hash
representing all the writes that have been recorded.  Each key of the hash
is the name of the variable or SFR that was written to, or just the address
that was written to if the write was to an unrecognized location in memory.
The values of the hash are the final value that the variable had after the
last write.  If a variable is written to more than once, the RAM watcher
will only report about the last write.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/MemoryWatcher.html#clear-instance_method" title="RPicSim::MemoryWatcher#clear (method)">clear</a></span> method erases all previous
records.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>For example, to test the 16-bit addition routine from the
<a href="file.Variables.html" title="Variables page">Variables page</a> with the RAM watcher, you could write:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_it'>it</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&quot;</span><span class='tstring_content'>adds x to y and stores the result in z</span><span class='tstring_end'>&quot;</span></span> <span class='kw'>do</span>
  <span class='id identifier rubyid_x'>x</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_value'>value</span> <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='int'>70</span>
  <span class='id identifier rubyid_y'>y</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_value'>value</span> <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='int'>22</span>
  <span class='id identifier rubyid_step'>step</span>
  <span class='id identifier rubyid_ram_watcher'>ram_watcher</span> <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_new_ram_watcher'>new_ram_watcher</span>
  <span class='id identifier rubyid_run_subroutine'>run_subroutine</span> <span class='symbol'>:addition</span><span class='comma'>,</span> <span class='label'>cycle_limit:</span> <span class='int'>100</span>
  <span class='id identifier rubyid_expect'>expect</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_ram_watcher'>ram_watcher</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_writes'>writes</span><span class='rparen'>)</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_to'>to</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_eq'>eq</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='lbrace'>{</span><span class='label'>z:</span> <span class='int'>92</span><span class='rbrace'>}</span><span class='rparen'>)</span>
<span class='kw'>end</span></code></pre>

<p>The third line in the example above advances the simulation by one step.
That initial step is necessary for two reasons:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Without it, the RAM watcher would report the writes to the <code>x</code>
and <code>z</code> variables performed above, even though those writes came
from Ruby code.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Without it, the RAM watcher would report spurious writes to several
registers such as INTCON and LATA.  On the first step of the simulation,
the MPLAB X code reports writes to several registers that were not caused
by the firmware.  We can avoid seeing them by taking a single step before
creating the RAM watcher.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The RAM watcher is an instance of <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/MemoryWatcher.html" title="RPicSim::MemoryWatcher (class)">RPicSim::MemoryWatcher</a></span>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Filters">Filters</h2>

<p>The <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/MemoryWatcher.html" title="RPicSim::MemoryWatcher (class)">RPicSim::MemoryWatcher</a></span> class contains some special code to filter out
reports about registers that very frequently change, like <code>PCL</code>
and <code>STATUS</code>.</p>
