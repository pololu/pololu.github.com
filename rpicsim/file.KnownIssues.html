<h1 id="label-Known+issues">Known issues</h1>

<p>This page documents all the known issues RPicSim has that could affect its
users. Some issues are caused by the MPLAB X simulator and would need to be
addressed by Microchip.</p>

<p>RPicSim has only been tested with the following versions of MPLAB X:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>1.85</p>
</li><li>
<p>1.90</p>
</li><li>
<p>1.95</p>
</li><li>
<p>2.00</p>
</li></ul>

<p>If you are using a different version of MPLAB X, some of the issues might
not apply to you.</p>

<p>Many of these issues have only been reproduced on a single model of PIC
microcontroller and they may or may not affect other models.</p>

<p>Many of these issues are also reported on other pages of this
<a href="file.Manual.html" title="manual">manual</a>, but this page is a complete list of all issues
that could affect users of RPicSim.</p>

<p>Internal issues that have been successfully worked around are not listed
here, but might be found in the RPicSim specs by searching for the word
"flaw".</p>

<p>There are almost certainly many issues that have not been found yet.</p>

<h2 id="label-MPLAB+X+simulator+does+not+support+all+PIC+devices+equally">MPLAB X simulator does not support all PIC devices equally</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X missing feature</em></p>

<p>Be sure to check the Device Support table to see if your device is properly
supported by the MPLAB X simulator. The table can be found in your MPLAB X
installation folder under "<code>docs/Device Support.htm</code>". The
<em>SIMISA</em> column probably stands for "Simulator (instruction set and
architecture)" while the <em>SIMP</em> column probably stands for
"Simulator (peripherals)".</p>

<h2 id="label-Simulation+timing+is+affected+by+the+details+of+how+long+each+instruction+takes">Simulation timing is affected by the details of how long each instruction takes</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X missing feature</em></p>

<p>As mentioned on the <a href="file.Running.html" title="Running">Running</a> page, RPicSim's only way to
advance the simulation is to execute an entire instruction. Some
instructions take two instruction cycles to run and others only take one.
When you request RPicSim to delay for a certain number of cycles, it might
need to delay by one cycle more than was requested since it cannot stop in
the middle of a two-cycle instruction. As a result, the timing of your
tests and the input signals you send to the simulated device can sometimes
be slightly off and these errors could accumulate in longer tests.</p>

<p>One workaround that prevents timing errors from accumulating is to only use
<span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Sim.html#run_to_cycle_count-instance_method" title="RPicSim::Sim#run_to_cycle_count (method)">RPicSim::Sim#run_to_cycle_count</a></span> to run the simulation.</p>

<h2 id="label-MPLAB+X+must+be+on+the+C+drive">MPLAB X must be on the C drive</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: all tested versions</em></p>

<p>In Windows, a bug in MPLAB X prevents RPicSim from using an MPLAB X
installed on any drive other than the C drive.</p>

<p>This issue is tested in <code>spec/mplab_x/path_retrieval_spec.rb</code>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Firmware+under+test+must+be+inside+a+folder+named+%22dist%22">Firmware under test must be inside a folder named "dist"</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: all tested versions</em></p>

<p>This issue is tested in <code>spec/mplab_x/program_file_spec.rb</code>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Limited+number+of+variable+types+supported">Limited number of variable types supported</h2>

<p><em>Type: RPicSim missing feature</em></p>

<p>There is no support for variables larger than 32 bits. There is no support
for arrays or structs of variables. There is also no support for reading
and writing directly from the simulated device's RAM, Flash, EEPROM, and
stack memories from Ruby.</p>

<h2 id="label-No+EEPROM+support">No EEPROM support</h2>

<p><em>Type: RPicSim missing feature</em></p>

<p>RPicSim does not support reading or writing from EEPROM from Ruby.</p>

<h2 id="label-Dissasembly+is+limited+to+midrange+and+baseline+PIC+microcontrollers">Dissasembly is limited to midrange and baseline PIC microcontrollers</h2>

<p><em>Type: RPicSim missing feature</em></p>

<p>The disassembled instruction graph created by <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/ProgramFile.html" title="RPicSim::ProgramFile (class)">RPicSim::ProgramFile</a></span>
currently only supports baseline and midrange PICs, but it should be easy
to expand to other PICs. This is a side feature of RPicSim, and not
required for simulation.</p>

<h2 id="label-Stack+trace+will+show+slightly+wrong+values+for+PIC18+microcontrollers">Stack trace will show slightly wrong values for PIC18 microcontrollers</h2>

<p><em>Type: RPicSim bug</em></p>

<p>For the PIC18, <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Sim.html#stack_trace-instance_method" title="RPicSim::Sim#stack_trace (method)">RPicSim::Sim#stack_trace</a></span> will probably show values that
are too high by one because it does not account for the fact that PIC18
instructions take two bytes.</p>

<h2 id="label-Cannot+detect+PIC+model+from+COF+file">Cannot detect PIC model from COF file</h2>

<p><em>Type: RPicSim missing feature</em></p>

<p>The MPLAB X code might allow RPicSim to detect the PIC device name from the
COF file so that the user does not have to specify it when creating a
<span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/ProgramFile.html" title="RPicSim::ProgramFile (class)">RPicSim::ProgramFile</a></span> or a subclass of <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Sim.html" title="RPicSim::Sim (class)">RPicSim::Sim</a></span>. Currently RPicSim
requires the user to always specify the PIC device name.</p>

<h2 id="label-Not+tested+on+Linux+and+Mac+OS+X">Not tested on Linux and Mac OS X</h2>

<p><em>Type: RPicSim missing feature</em></p>

<p>RPicSim has not been tested on Linux and Mac OS X. See
<a href="file.SupportedOperatingSystems.html" title="Supported operating systems">Supported operating systems</a> for more
information.</p>

<h2 id="label-Variables+defined+in+user+ID+space+are+not+read+from+the+COF+file">Variables defined in user ID space are not read from the COF file</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X version affected: all tested versions</em></p>

<p>The workaround is to simply set any variables defined in user ID space to
the correct values from Ruby before running the simulation. This issue is
tested in <code>spec/integration/flash_variable_spec.rb</code>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Simulated+firmware+cannot+write+to+the+first+user+ID+location">Simulated firmware cannot write to the first user ID location</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: 1.85, 1.90</em></p>

<p>This issue is tested in
<code>spec/integration/flash_variable_spec.rb</code>. It has been
<a href="http://www.microchip.com/forums/m743214.aspx" target="_parent" title="reported to Microchip">reported to Microchip</a> and
was fixed in later versions.</p>

<h2 id="label-Pins+report+the+wrong+output+state+if+the+ANSELx+bit+is+1">Pins report the wrong output state if the ANSELx bit is 1</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: all tested versions</em></p>

<p>The ANSELx bit for a real PIC pin only disables the digital input circuitry
and should not affect the pin's use as a digital output. However, if the
ANSELx bit is set to 1, then <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Pin.html#driving_low%3F-instance_method" title="RPicSim::Pin#driving_low? (method)">RPicSim::Pin#driving_low?</a></span> always seems to
return true even if the pin is actually driving high.</p>

<p>This issue is tested in <code>spec/integration/pin_spec.rb</code>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Pins+report+the+wrong+output+state+if+LATx+is+set+before+TRISx">Pins report the wrong output state if LATx is set before TRISx</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: all tested versions</em></p>

<p>Updating a pin's LATx bit before its clearing its TRISx bit is the proper
way to turn on an output pin without causing glitches. However, if you set
the two bits in that order then <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Pin.html#driving_low%3F-instance_method" title="RPicSim::Pin#driving_low? (method)">RPicSim::Pin#driving_low?</a></span> always seems to
return true even if the pin is actually driving high.</p>

<p>This issue is tested in <code>spec/integration/pin_spec.rb</code>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Pins+report+the+wrong+output+state+if+TRISx+is+cleared+again">Pins report the wrong output state if TRISx is cleared again</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: all tested versions</em></p>

<p>Even if you set up the pin properly (working around all the issues above)
and get <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Pin.html#driving_high%3F-instance_method" title="RPicSim::Pin#driving_high? (method)">RPicSim::Pin#driving_high?</a></span> to return true, a <code>bcf</code>
instruction on the pin's TRISx bit (or probably any write to the TRISx
register) will cause the pin to start reporting the wrong output state.</p>

<p>This issue is tested in <code>spec/integration/pin_spec.rb</code>.</p>

<h2 id="label-RAM+watcher+is+useless+because+all+of+RAM+seems+to+change+on+every+step">RAM watcher is useless because all of RAM seems to change on every step</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: 1.95, 2.00</em></p>

<p>This issue is tested in <code>spec/mplab_x/memory_attach_spec.rb</code>. If
you want to use the <a href="file.RamWatcher.html" title="RAM watcher">RAM watcher</a>, you should use MPLAB
X version 1.85 or 1.90.</p>

<h2 id="label-RAM+watcher+reports+a+write+to+PORTA+instead+of+to+LATA">RAM watcher reports a write to PORTA instead of to LATA</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: all tested versions</em></p>

<p>The <a href="file.RamWatcher.html" title="RAM watcher">RAM watcher</a>, when testing code that writes to
LATA, might actually report it as a write to PORTA instead of LATA. This
issue has been observed on a PIC10F322 but it probably affects other PORTx
and LATx registers.</p>

<p>This issue is tested in <code>spec/integration/ram_watcher_spec.rb</code>.
This issue could not be tested on MPLAB X versions affected by the "RAM
watcher is useless" issue above.</p>

<h2 id="label-Midrange+ADC+gives+incorrect+readings">Midrange ADC gives incorrect readings</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: all tested versions</em></p>

<p>The simulated ADC for midrange PIC microcontrollers has various issues in
different versions of MPLAB X that make it give incorrect readings. These
issues might affect other PIC architectures as well.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Bad modulus:</strong> In MPLAB X 1.90 and later, simply setting a
pin to high with <code>pin.set(true)</code> will result in an ADC reading
of 0.  The workaround is to use <code>pin.set(4.9)</code>.  The ADC acts
like it is using a modulus operator incorrectly as a way of limiting the
ADC result to be between 0 and 255.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>No intermediate values:</strong> In MPLAB X 1.85, setting a pin to
any voltage other than 0 V will result in an ADC reading of 255.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>These issues are tested in
<code>spec/integration/adc_midrange_spec.rb</code>. The bad modulus issue
was <a href="http://www.microchip.com/forums/m760886.aspx" target="_parent" title="reported to Microchip">reported to Microchip</a> in
November 2013.</p>
