<h1 id="label-Known+issues">Known issues</h1>

<p>This page documents all the known issues RPicSim has that could affect its
users. Some issues are caused by the MPLAB X simulator and would need to be
addressed by Microchip.</p>

<p>RPicSim has only been tested with the versions of MPLAB X that are listed
on the <a href="index.html" title="Introduction">Introduction</a> page. If you are using a different version of
MPLAB X, you might have different issues.</p>

<p>Many of these issues have only been reproduced on a single model of PIC
microcontroller and they may or may not affect other models.</p>

<p>Many of these issues are also reported on other pages of this
<a href="file.Manual.html" title="manual">manual</a>, but this page is a complete list of all issues
that could affect users of RPicSim.</p>

<p>Internal issues that have been successfully worked around are not listed
here, but might be found in the RPicSim specs by searching for the word
"flaw".</p>

<p>There are almost certainly many issues that have not been found yet.</p>

<h2 id="label-MPLAB+X+simulator+does+not+support+all+PIC+devices+equally">MPLAB X simulator does not support all PIC devices equally</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X missing feature</em></p>

<p>Be sure to check the Device Support table to see if your device is properly
supported by the MPLAB X simulator. The table can be found in your MPLAB X
installation folder under "<code>docs/Device Support.htm</code>". The
<em>SIMISA</em> column probably stands for "Simulator (instruction set and
architecture)" while the <em>SIMP</em> column probably stands for
"Simulator (peripherals)".</p>

<h2 id="label-Simulation+timing+is+affected+by+the+details+of+how+long+each+instruction+takes">Simulation timing is affected by the details of how long each instruction takes</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X missing feature</em></p>

<p>As mentioned on the <a href="file.Running.html" title="Running">Running</a> page, RPicSim's only way to
advance the simulation is to execute an entire instruction. Some
instructions take two instruction cycles to run and others only take one.
When you request RPicSim to delay for a certain number of cycles, it might
need to delay by one cycle more than was requested since it cannot stop in
the middle of a two-cycle instruction. As a result, the timing of your
tests and the input signals you send to the simulated device can sometimes
be slightly off and these errors could accumulate in longer tests.</p>

<p>One workaround that prevents timing errors from accumulating is to only use
<span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Sim.html#run_to_cycle_count-instance_method" title="RPicSim::Sim#run_to_cycle_count (method)">RPicSim::Sim#run_to_cycle_count</a></span> to run the simulation.</p>

<h2 id="label-MPLAB+X+must+be+on+the+C+drive">MPLAB X must be on the C drive</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: all tested versions</em></p>

<p>In Windows, a bug in MPLAB X prevents RPicSim from using an MPLAB X
installed on any drive other than the C drive.</p>

<p>This issue is tested in <code>spec/mplab/path_retrieval_spec.rb</code>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Firmware+under+test+must+be+inside+a+folder+named+%22dist%22">Firmware under test must be inside a folder named "dist"</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: all tested versions</em></p>

<p>This issue is tested in <code>spec/mplab/program_file_spec.rb</code>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Cannot+detect+PIC+model+from+COF+file">Cannot detect PIC model from COF file</h2>

<p><em>Type: RPicSim missing feature</em></p>

<p>Currently RPicSim requires the user to always specify the PIC device name
when creating a <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/ProgramFile.html" title="RPicSim::ProgramFile (class)">RPicSim::ProgramFile</a></span> or a subclass of <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Sim.html" title="RPicSim::Sim (class)">RPicSim::Sim</a></span>,
even though it might be possible to get that information from the COF file.</p>

<h2 id="label-Variables+defined+in+user+ID+space+are+not+read+from+the+COF+file">Variables defined in user ID space are not read from the COF file</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X version affected: all tested versions</em></p>

<p>If your firmware uses variables stored in user ID space, the workaround for
this issue is to simply set any variables defined in user ID space to the
correct values from Ruby before running the simulation. This issue is
tested in <code>spec/integration/program_memory_variable_spec.rb</code>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Simulated+firmware+cannot+write+to+the+first+user+ID+location">Simulated firmware cannot write to the first user ID location</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: 1.85, 1.90</em></p>

<p>This issue is tested in
<code>spec/integration/program_memory_variable_spec.rb</code>. It has been
<a href="http://www.microchip.com/forums/m743214.aspx" target="_parent" title="reported to Microchip">reported to Microchip</a> and
was fixed in later versions.</p>

<h2 id="label-Pins+report+the+wrong+output+state+if+the+ANSELx+bit+is+1">Pins report the wrong output state if the ANSELx bit is 1</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: all tested versions</em></p>

<p>The ANSELx bit for a real PIC pin only disables the digital input circuitry
and should not affect the pin's use as a digital output. However, if the
ANSELx bit is set to 1, then <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Pin.html#driving_low%3F-instance_method" title="RPicSim::Pin#driving_low? (method)">RPicSim::Pin#driving_low?</a></span> always seems to
return true even if the pin is actually driving high.</p>

<p>This issue is tested in <code>spec/integration/pin_spec.rb</code>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Pins+report+the+wrong+output+state+if+LATx+is+set+before+TRISx">Pins report the wrong output state if LATx is set before TRISx</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: all tested versions</em></p>

<p>Updating a pin's LATx bit before its clearing its TRISx bit is the proper
way to turn on an output pin without causing glitches. However, if you set
the two bits in that order then <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Pin.html#driving_low%3F-instance_method" title="RPicSim::Pin#driving_low? (method)">RPicSim::Pin#driving_low?</a></span> always seems to
return true even if the pin is actually driving high.</p>

<p>This issue is tested in <code>spec/integration/pin_spec.rb</code>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Pins+report+the+wrong+output+state+if+TRISx+is+cleared+again">Pins report the wrong output state if TRISx is cleared again</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: all tested versions</em></p>

<p>Even if you set up the pin properly (working around all the issues above)
and get <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Pin.html#driving_high%3F-instance_method" title="RPicSim::Pin#driving_high? (method)">RPicSim::Pin#driving_high?</a></span> to return true, a <code>bcf</code>
instruction on the pin's TRISx bit (or probably any write to the TRISx
register) will cause the pin to start reporting the wrong output state.</p>

<p>This issue is tested in <code>spec/integration/pin_spec.rb</code>.</p>

<h2 id="label-RAM+watcher+is+useless+because+all+of+RAM+seems+to+change+on+every+step">RAM watcher is useless because all of RAM seems to change on every step</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: 1.95, 2.00, 2.05</em></p>

<p>This issue is tested in <code>spec/mplab/memory_attach_spec.rb</code>. If
you want to use the <a href="file.RamWatcher.html" title="RAM watcher">RAM watcher</a>, you should use MPLAB
X version 1.85 or 1.90.</p>

<h2 id="label-RAM+watcher+reports+a+write+to+PORTA+and+LATA+when+LATA+is+written">RAM watcher reports a write to PORTA and LATA when LATA is written</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: all tested versions</em></p>

<p>The <a href="file.RamWatcher.html" title="RAM watcher">RAM watcher</a>, when testing code that writes to
LATA, might actually report both a write to LATA and a write to PORTA. This
issue has been observed on a PIC10F322 but it probably affects other PORTx
and LATx registers on other devices.</p>

<p>This issue is tested in <code>spec/integration/ram_watcher_spec.rb</code>.
This issue could not be tested on MPLAB X versions affected by the "RAM
watcher is useless" issue above.</p>

<h2 id="label-RAM+watcher+reports+extra+writes+on+devices+where+registers+have+multiple+addresses">RAM watcher reports extra writes on devices where registers have multiple addresses</h2>

<p><em>Type: RPicSim missing feature</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: all tested verisons</em></p>

<p>On certain devices, some registers are available at multiple addresses.
When the value of the register changes, the RAM watcher will report writes
to each of the addresses that the register occupies, which makes the
resulting hash large and hard to work with.</p>

<p>For example, on the PIC16F1459, PCL occupies the third byte of each of the
32 banks of RAM, so it can be accessed no matter which bank is selected.
Whenever the program counter advances, the RAM watcher reports writes to
all 32 addresses that PCL occupies.</p>

<p>One workaround is to write a helper function that filters uninteresting
addresses out of the hash returned by the RAM watcher.</p>

<p>This issue is tested in <code>spec/integration/ram_watcher_spec.rb</code>.
This issue could not be tested on MPLAB X versions affected by the "RAM
watcher is useless" issue above.</p>

<h2 id="label-RAM+watchers+cannot+be+garbage+collected+until+the+end+of+the+simulation">RAM watchers cannot be garbage collected until the end of the simulation</h2>

<p><em>Type: RPicSim missing feature</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: all</em></p>

<p>Any instance of <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/MemoryWatcher.html" title="RPicSim::MemoryWatcher (class)">RPicSim::MemoryWatcher</a></span>, including RAM watchers, cannot be
garbage collected until the associated <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Sim.html" title="RPicSim::Sim (class)">RPicSim::Sim</a></span> object gets garbage
collected. This is because some internal objects managed by the Sim class
need to hold on to a reference to the RAM watcher in order to send updates
to it.</p>

<p>Therefore, creating a large number of RAM watcher objects for a single
simulation could cause performance problems.</p>

<p>This problem could be fixed in the future by using Ruby's WeakRef class to
make weak references.</p>

<h2 id="label-Midrange+ADC+gives+incorrect+readings">Midrange ADC gives incorrect readings</h2>

<p><em>Type: MPLAB X bug</em></p>

<p><em>MPLAB X versions affected: all tested versions</em></p>

<p>The simulated ADC for midrange PIC microcontrollers has various issues in
different versions of MPLAB X that make it give incorrect readings. These
issues might affect other PIC architectures as well.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Bad modulus:</strong> In MPLAB X 1.90 and later, simply setting a
pin to high with <code>pin.set(true)</code> will result in an ADC reading
of 0.  The workaround is to use <code>pin.set(4.9)</code>.  The ADC acts
like it is using a modulus operator incorrectly as a way of limiting the
ADC result to be between 0 and 255.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>No intermediate values:</strong> In MPLAB X 1.85, setting a pin to
any voltage other than 0 V will result in an ADC reading of 255.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>These issues are tested in
<code>spec/integration/adc_midrange_spec.rb</code>. The bad modulus issue
was <a href="http://www.microchip.com/forums/m760886.aspx" target="_parent" title="reported to Microchip">reported to Microchip</a> in
November 2013.</p>
