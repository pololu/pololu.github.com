<p>RPicSim uses the <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Memory.html" title="RPicSim::Memory (class)">RPicSim::Memory</a></span> class to provide access to the RAM,
EEPROM, and program memory of the simulated device. This is useful if you
want to interact with variables and data structures in your firmware that
are too complex to be handled by RPicSim&#39;s <a href="file.Variables.html" title="Variables">Variables</a> feature,
like strings, structs, and buffers.</p>

<h2 id="label-RAM+and+EEPROM">RAM and EEPROM</h2>

<p>To get the <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Memory.html" title="RPicSim::Memory (class)">Memory</a></span> object that represents RAM, call
<span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Sim.html#ram-instance_method" title="RPicSim::Sim#ram (method)">RPicSim::Sim#ram</a></span>. To get the <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Memory.html" title="RPicSim::Memory (class)">Memory</a></span> object that
represents EEPROM, call <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Sim.html#eeprom-instance_method" title="RPicSim::Sim#eeprom (method)">RPicSim::Sim#eeprom</a></span>. The two main methods to use
on these objects are:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><code>read_byte(address)</code>: This method takes a byte address and
returns the value of that byte.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>write_byte(address, value)</code>: This method takes a byte address
and a value between 0 and 255, and writes the value to the specified byte.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>For example, if you are using RPicSim&#39;s <a href="file.RSpecIntegration.html" title="RSpec integration">RSpec integration</a> you can read and write from <code>ram</code> like this:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_ram'>ram</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_write_byte'>write_byte</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='int'>0x200</span><span class='comma'>,</span> <span class='int'>0x80</span><span class='rparen'>)</span>
<span class='id identifier rubyid_expect'>expect</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_ram'>ram</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_read_byte'>read_byte</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='int'>0x200</span><span class='rparen'>)</span><span class='rparen'>)</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_to'>to</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_eq'>eq</span> <span class='int'>0x80</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="label-Program+memory">Program memory</h2>

<p>To get the <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Memory.html" title="RPicSim::Memory (class)">Memory</a></span> object that represents program memory,
call <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Sim.html#program_memory-instance_method" title="RPicSim::Sim#program_memory (method)">RPicSim::Sim#program_memory</a></span>. In addition to letting you access the
main part of program memory which contains the program, this object also
allows access to the configuration words and user ID words. The program
memory is also known as flash, ROM, and code space.</p>

<p>The program memory object behaves differently depending on whether your are
simulating a PIC18 device or a non-PIC18 device, as described below.</p>

<h3 id="label-Program+memory+on+a+non-PIC18+devices">Program memory on a non-PIC18 devices</h3>

<p>On non-PIC18 devices, the program memory is divided into <em>words</em>
that are either 12 bits wide or 14 bits wide. In RPicSim, non-PIC18 program
memory addresses are always specified as <em>word addresses</em>. For
example, the address 0 corresponds to the first <em>word</em>, while the
address 1 corresponds to the second word. The <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Memory.html" title="RPicSim::Memory (class)">Memory</a></span>
object provides two methods for reading and writing from these words:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><code>read_word(address)</code>: This method takes a word address and
returns the value of that word.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>write_word(address, value)</code>: This method takes a word address
and a numerical value, and writes the value to the specified word.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The program memory on a non-PIC18 device can also be thought of as a series
of bytes, and it is often represented this way in HEX files. Each word can
be thought of as two consecutive bytes, with the lower 8 bits residing in
the first byte and upper 4 bits or 6 bits residing in the second byte. The
valid range of values for the second byte, therefore, is limited.</p>

<p>The <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Memory.html" title="RPicSim::Memory (class)">Memory</a></span> object provides two methods for reading and
writing the least-significant bytes of the words in program memory:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><code>read_byte(address)</code>: This method takes a <em>word</em> address
and returns the lower 8 bits of that word, ignoring the upper bits.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>write_byte(address)</code>: This method takes a <em>word</em> address
and a value between 0 and 255 and writes the value to the lower 8 bits of
that word, leaving the upper bits unchanged.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Since these methods take word addresses instead of byte addresses, they
cannot access the upper bits of a program memory word.</p>

<h3 id="label-Program+memory+on+PIC18+devices">Program memory on PIC18 devices</h3>

<p>On PIC18 devices, the program memory is divided into 16-bit words. Since
each word can hold exactly two bytes, the program memory is often treated
as a series of bytes in development tools. In RPicSim, PIC18 program memory
addresses are always specified as <em>byte addresses</em>.</p>

<p>The <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Memory.html" title="RPicSim::Memory (class)">Memory</a></span> object provides two methods for reading and
writing words from program memory:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><code>read_word(address)</code>: This method takes a byte address and
returns the value of the 2-byte word starting at that address.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>write_word(address, value)</code>: This method takes a byte address
and a numerical value, and writes the value to the 2-byte word starting at
the specified address.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>If you supply an odd address to <code>read_word</code> or
<code>write_word</code>, the operation will apply to two bytes that are
actually from two different words.</p>

<p>The <span class='object_link'><a href="RPicSim/Memory.html" title="RPicSim::Memory (class)">Memory</a></span> object provides two methods for reading and
writing bytes from program memory:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><code>read_byte(address)</code>: This method takes a <em>byte</em> address
and returns the value of that byte.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>write_byte(address)</code>: This method takes a <em>byte</em> address
and a value between 0 and 255 and writes the value to that byte, leaving
other bytes unchanged.</p>
</li></ul>
